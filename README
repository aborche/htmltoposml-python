Project in deep development!!!
Some documentation not exist.

1. Dependencies

In order to start getting access to your printer, you must ensure
you have previously installed the following python modules:

  * pyusb (python-usb)
  * PIL (Python Image Library)

See example.py and source code for info

2. How to find your printer

Before start create your Python ESC/POS printer instance, you must
see at your system for the printer parameters. This is done with
the 'lsusb' command.

First run the command to look for the "Vendor ID" and "Product ID",
then write down the values, these values are displayed just before
the name of the device with the following format:

xxxx:xxxx

Example:
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1a2b:1a2b Device name

Write down the the values in question, then issue the following
command so you can get the "Interface" number and "End Point"

lsusb -vvv -d xxxx:xxxx | grep iInterface
lsusb -vvv -d xxxx:xxxx | grep bEndpointAddress | grep OUT

The first command will yields the "Interface" number that must
be handy to have and the second yields the "Output Endpoint"
address.

By default the "Interface" number is "0" and the "Output Endpoint"
address is "0x82", if you have other values then you can define
with your instance.

For printing data on printer just add your account to "lp" group and
re-login.

--------------------- This text from escpos-python -------------------
On Linux, ensure you belongs to the proper group so you can have access to
the printer.
This can be done, by adding yourself to 'dialout' group, this might require
to re-login so the changes make effect.

Then, add the following rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-escpos.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04b8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0202", MODE="0664", GROUP="dialout"

and restart udev rules.
# sudo service udev restart

3. Run example.py for get democode

4. Edit and run democode file. Run `cat 'test.file' > /dev/usb/<usb printer address>`

5. Enjoy
